# Call For Artist Submissions

Virtual Backgrounds highlights a finite selection of hand-picked and original backgrounds specifically chosen for leveling up your next video conference. Users can save these backgrounds to their devices to use with their video conferencing tool (Zoom, Teams, etc).

I’m looking to expand and feature **artists and photographers** who have created pieces that would work well as a virtual background.

## What you get
1. A dedicated section in the app that features your work
2. An Artist Profile page that contains your bio and links to your website, social links, etc

If you’d be interested in getting your art featured in the app, just drop me a note!
