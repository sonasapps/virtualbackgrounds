# Version History
Be sure to check for updates as Virtual Backgrounds is updated regularly!

<br>
### `Latest Release`
# **Version 3.0**
Exciting news! The Virtual Backgrounds App has been rebuilt from the ground up in native SwiftUI featuring an all new design! More on that below.<br>

• Optimized for iOS 14 (minimum supported iOS/iPadOS version: 14.0)<br>
• All new design<br>
• Support for iOS 14 Widgets<br>
• 12 new backgrounds<br>
• As always, Virtual Backgrounds doesn't collect any personal data<br>

Why does it matter that the app was rebuilt in native SwiftUI? This means that the app is setup for longer-term support, feature additions, improvements, and expanded device support. I'm excited to be able to continue adding new capabilities to future Virtual Background updates, as well as getting a macOS version out soon. 
Although this release is technically "3.0" it's almost like a "1.0" as we're starting fresh with this completely new user experience. I hope you like it!

Unfortunately this also means dropping support for older iOS versions. If you're on any of the following devices, the good news is that your device supports iOS 14!<br>


### `Last Release`
## **Version 2.0**
Version 2.0 is the biggest update since the launch of Virtual Backgrounds!<br>
• Landscape support is here! Both iPad and iPhone users can browse beautiful backgrounds in portait or landscape mode<br>
• Improved image browsing performance -- version 2.0 uses an all new image viewer object to make scrolling through image faster and smoother<br>
• User experience improvements -- many enhancements and tweaks throughout the app<br>
• Over 100 hand-picked backgrounds including a growing catalog of original content<br>
